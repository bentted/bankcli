## Features

### üîí Secure User Management
- User registration with validation.
- User login with password authentication.
- Account verification to ensure data integrity.

### üíæ Persistent Data Storage
- Stores user data securely for future reference and transactions.

### ‚ö° Fast and Lightweight
- Written in Rust, ensuring high performance and low memory usage.

### üõ† Modular Design
- Divided into client and server modules for better maintainability and scalability.

## Repository Structure

| File/Folder      | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Cargo.toml`     | Contains metadata and dependencies for the Rust project.                   |
| `client.rs`      | Handles client-side operations, such as user interactions and input.       |
| `server.rs`      | Manages server-side logic, such as data validation and database handling.   |
| `main.rs`        | The entry point of the application, orchestrating client and server logic. |

## How It Works

### 1. User Registration
- Users can register by providing a username and password.
- Input validation ensures only valid data is accepted.

### 2. Login and Authentication
- Existing users can log in to access their account.
- Passwords are securely handled to protect user privacy.

### 3. Account Verification
- The system verifies user accounts to prevent unauthorized access.
- Ensures only registered users can interact with the application.

### 4. Modular Architecture
- **Client Module**: Handles user input, CLI interactions, and communication with the server.
- **Server Module**: Processes requests, validates data, and manages storage.
